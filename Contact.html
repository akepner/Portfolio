    <h1>My Manifesto:</h1>

  <p>Full of diversity and various economic and social happenings, we have been brought up in a world in which the designs in specific brand names and advertisements strike immediate recognition among the population of today's society. The average human applauds the clever and intricate incorporation of specific, but simplex logo designs that strike the mind automatically. The individuals in today's society are instantly pleased when they are able to recognize something in a brand name or logo, and that further drives their will to buy a product and makes a company more successful as a whole.</p>
  
  <p>In efforts to cater to this idea, I have found that recognition is key when pleasing a client or an audience. There are billboards, street signs, buses, clothing, films, television commercials, photography, books, buildings, stores and more that linger in the minds of viewers and consumers that seem to be the most successful in the design and advertising industry overall.</p>

  <p>Having said all this, I hope to produce designs and materials that connect with an audience. Nevertheless, I do not necessarily find it imperative to create only positive imagery and designs, but I hope to create designs that will be instantly stick in the mind of a viewer. I do not advocate the abolition of intricate designs: this is not related. I want to pursue the idea of the basic understandings of a design and create something successful to the human mind. With this in mind, I propose to share my ideas and experiences through design and make them available to colleagues, students and others who may be interested.</p>
