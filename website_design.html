<h2>Atmosphere Weather Website</h2>
<p>This assignment was to create a website about an application I designed. The application is not able to be used, but the website shows everything about the idea. The application, "Atmosphere", was designed for guidance and information about the weather in a specific area of the world. "Atmosphere" was created simplistically on purpose. This idea reassures the user of easy readability and immediate access to exactly what they are looking for when opening the application. Each screen is different, but the main concerns are prevalent throughout. The website encourages the use of the application by using visuals and descriptions throughout the site.</p>

<h3>Mountaineer Spay Neuter Assistance Program</h3>
<p>This website was to redesign a spay and neutering website that was a bit jumbled. For this site, I took a look at the old M-SNAP website and sectioned it off into various categories. Next, I made a toolbar with my categories to guide a user throughout the site.</p>
